Predicting Heart Failure Readmission from Clinical Notes Using Deep Learning
Hospitalization due to heart failure exerts a great pressure on the healthcare system in the USA. This is further true among the elderly citizens. Predicting early the patients with high readmission risk can help healthcare providers identify patients to prevent readmissions that can be avoided. Traditional machine learning models have the limitation to interpret clinical notes to predict readmissions. That is where deep learning models perform significantly better. Much research has been done in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning methods, which have helped machines to learn a varied medical language representation that led to efficient and accurate predictions. Min et. al [2] created a predictive model to capture the risk of hospital readmission from the patientsâ€™ claim data. The use of deep learning using large scale adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHR) has been demonstrated by researchers like Jamei et. al [3] and Ahsfaq et al. [4]. We aim to leverage NLP and Deep Learning to provide newer perspectives on readmission.
